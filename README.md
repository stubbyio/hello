# Stubby IO

Stubby IO uses the Stubby YML syntax to create live, scaleable, shareable API stubs directly from your GitHub repository.

Collaborate with your team and quickly create API prototypes that you can test with your code.

Create stubs for load testing your application.

To get started:

- Create a repository, or clone this one, with a `stubby.yml` file in it
- Create a webhook pointing to `webhook.stubby.io` so we know when you update your stub
- Your API is now hosted on `http://{github username}-{repo name}.stubby.io`
- This one, for example, can be found at http://stubbyio-hello.stubby.io
- Profit ðŸ¤‘

## Syntax

The full Stubby syntax is here:

Most of it is supported, I'm working on the documentation ðŸ˜œ
